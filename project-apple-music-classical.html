                <p>In 2023, Apple released Apple Music Classical as a standalone app focused on classical music.</p>
                <p>The work looks at four main areas of the app: Search, Listen Now, Browse and Library; and proposes UX
                    and UI refinements to improve alignment with Apple Music while still respecting the specifics of
                    classical metadata and listening habits.</p>

                <h2 class="section-headline">Why classical needs a different lens.</h2>
                <p>Classical music is difficult to categorize. It spans centuries, styles, ensembles and recording
                    histories, and a single work can exist in many versions with different performers, conductors and
                    languages. <strong>Traditional tags such as artist, album and song title are not enough.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Apple Music Classical was created to make this world easier to search and browse, but it inevitably
                    diverges from Apple Music in structure and behavior. <strong>This case study examines those
                        differences and asks how far the two apps should converge to support both beginners and
                        experts.</strong></p>

            <section class="detail-section fade-in" style="margin-top: var(--spacing-3xl);">
                <h2 class="detail-section-title">Search</h2>
                <p>Searching for classical music is not as straightforward as finding a Dua Lipa song. Traditional music
                    metadata usually focuses on artist, genre, song title or album title. Classical music metadata adds
                    many more dimensions, including composers, conductors, orchestras and choirs.</p>
                <p>Because there is no standard classification system for classical music, users often struggle to find
                    specific pieces or recordings. A single work can have many versions by different performers and in
                    different languages. For example, Giacomo Puccini’s opera <em>La Bohème</em> has been recorded and
                    performed countless times, making it hard to pinpoint a specific interpretation.</p>
            </section>

            <div class="detail-img oversize-img fade-in">

                    alt="La Bohème by Giacomo Puccini searched on Spotify and Apple Music Classical.">
                <p class="detail-img-caption" style="text-align: center;"><em>La Bohème</em> by Giacomo Puccini searched
                    on Spotify and Apple Music Classical.</p>

            <section class="detail-section fade-in">
                <p>The Search tab in Apple Music Classical differs from the one in Apple Music. It offers a list of
                    textual suggestions without categories or recommended playlists, which are currently placed in the
                    Browse section. <strong>Integrating catalog listings, editor‑picked playlists and categories
                        directly into Search would help users find what they need more easily, regardless of their level
                        of expertise, and make exploration more natural.</strong></p>
                <p>In the concept, the segmented control is replaced by collections with a “Show All” chevron, allowing
                    users to reveal full lists without switching views.</p>

                <h2 class="detail-section-title">Listen Now</h2>
                <p>In Apple Music, the Listen Now tab provides a personalized selection of songs and playlists based on
                    listening history and preferences. Apple Music Classical, instead, shows currently popular and new
                    releases, without individual recommendations. This behavior overlaps with what the Browse tab is
                    expected to do.</p>
                <p>Integrating personalized recommendations based on the user’s interests would redefine the classical
                    experience. <strong>A redesigned Listen Now for Apple Music Classical suggests relevant playlists,
                        works, recordings, genres and what friends are listening to, similar to Apple Music’s Listen Now
                        tab.</strong> This turns it into a true, personal entry point into the classical catalog.</p>

                <h2 class="detail-section-title">Browse</h2>
                <p>In Apple Music Classical, the Browse tab uses a segmented control to switch between Catalog,
                    Playlists and Instruments, which creates a different experience compared to Browse in Apple Music.
                </p>
                <p>The proposed Browse integrates selected playlists, popular recordings and new releases, currently
                    found in Listen Now, into a single view. Users can discover expert‑curated collections organized by
                    factors such as mood, activity and genre, while still accessing classical‑specific dimensions like
                    instruments.</p>
                <p><strong>In this way, the Browse tab in Apple Music Classical offers a more familiar, Apple Music‑like
                        structure, while still highlighting what makes classical content unique.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="detail-section-title">Library</h2>
                <p>The Library tab in Apple Music Classical presents a list of filters but does not include the Recently
                    Added section available in Apple Music. However, items added in Apple Music Classical do appear in
                    the Recently Added section of the Apple Music library, which can create confusion. It is unclear
                    whether this omission is intentional.</p>
                <p>In the concept, an Edit button in the navigation bar lets users choose which lists to display or
                    hide, such as albums or playlists. <strong>Combined with a Recently Added section, these
                        organizational enhancements give listeners more control over albums, playlists, composers and
                        works, and bring the Library tab closer to the Apple Music experience.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="detail-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The analysis of Apple Music Classical shows that differences in information architecture and content
                    presentation have a direct impact on how comfortable users feel moving between it and Apple Music.
                </p>
                <p>Enhancing Search with integrated categories and playlists, bringing personalization to Listen Now,
                    restructuring Browse for familiarity, and aligning Library with Recently Added and editable filters
                    all point to a more coherent experience—<strong>one where Apple Music Classical feels distinct yet
                        clearly part of the same ecosystem.</strong></p>
